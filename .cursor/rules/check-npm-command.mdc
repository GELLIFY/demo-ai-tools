Rule Name: check-npm-command.mdc
Description: 
When a user asks to run a terminal command, first check if it exists in package.json scripts.

Guidelines:
1. If the command matches a script in package.json, run using pnpm
2. For commands like "npm run dev" or "yarn dev", extract the script name and check if it exists in scripts
3. Always use pnpm as the package manager regardless of what was requested
4. If the command doesn't exist, inform the user and suggest available similar commands

Example:
- If user asks to run "npm run build", suggest "pnpm build" instead
- If user asks to run "yarn dev", suggest "pnpm dev" instead
- If user asks for a command that doesn't exist, list similar available commands
